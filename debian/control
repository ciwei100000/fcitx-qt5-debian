Description: Free Chinese Input Toy of X - Qt5 IM Module frontend
 Fcitx is the Free Chinese Input Toy of X, which was initially designed
 for Chinese users, and used XIM protocol. Now it has already evolved
 into a highly modularized, feature rich input method framework for
 Unix-like platforms supporting a considerable amount of frontends,
 backends and modules.
 .
 It offers a pleasant and modern experience, with intuitive graphical
 configuration tools and customizable skins and mapping tables.
 It is highly modularized and extensible,
 with GTK+ 2/3 and Qt 4/5 IM Modules, support for UIs based on Fbterm,
 pure Xlib, GTK+, or KDE, and a developer-friendly API.
 .
 This package provides the Qt5 IM Module frontend, which is necessary
 for Fcitx users who would like to use Qt5 applications.
